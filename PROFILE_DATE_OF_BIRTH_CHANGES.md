# Profile Date of Birth Changes - Summary

## Overview
The Profile model has been updated to store `date_of_birth` instead of `age`. This provides better data integrity as the date of birth is immutable, while age needs constant updating. Age is now computed on the fly when needed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Model Changes

#### models.py
- **Profile Model:**
  - Replaced `age: int` field with `date_of_birth: date` field
  - Updated example in json_schema_extra to use date format

### 2. Repository Changes

#### database/repositories/profiles.py
- **get_profile():** Computes age from date_of_birth when retrieving a profile
- **search_profiles():** 
  - Constructs MongoDB queries to filter by date_of_birth based on age criteria
  - Filtering happens at database level for optimal performance
  - Computes age for display after profiles are retrieved
- **get_all_profiles():** Computes age for all profiles returned

### 3. Sample Data Changes

#### database/sample_profiles.json
- Updated all sample profiles to use `date_of_birth` instead of `age`
- Added `experience_years` field to all profiles
- Date format: "YYYY-MM-DD" (e.g., "1996-03-15")

### 4. Database Seeding

#### seed_db.py
- Converts date_of_birth strings to datetime objects for MongoDB storage
- Adds default experience_years if not present
- Shows computed age when verifying seeded data

## How Age Computation Works

Age is calculated using the standard formula:
```python
age = today.year - dob.year - ((today.month, today.day) < (dob.month, dob.day))
```

This correctly handles:
- Leap years
- Birthdays that haven't occurred yet this year
- Edge cases around month/day boundaries

## Search Functionality

The search criteria still uses `age_min` and `age_max` parameters:
- Users specify age ranges in their search criteria
- MongoDB queries are constructed to filter by date_of_birth directly:
  - For `age_min`: finds profiles with `date_of_birth <= (today - age_min years)`
  - For `age_max`: finds profiles with `date_of_birth > (today - age_max - 1 years)`
- This approach is efficient as filtering happens at the database level
- Age is computed only for display purposes after profiles are retrieved

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity:** Date of birth never changes, unlike age
2. **Accuracy:** Age is always current when computed
3. **No Maintenance:** No need for scheduled jobs to update ages
4. **Historical Accuracy:** Can compute age at any point in time if needed
5. **Legal Compliance:** Many systems require storing actual birth date for verification

## Frontend Compatibility

The frontend continues to work with age values:
- When displaying profiles, the backend provides computed `age` field
- Search criteria still uses age ranges (min/max)
- No frontend changes required for this update

## Migration Notes

For existing production data:
1. Need to migrate existing `age` fields to `date_of_birth`
2. Calculate approximate birth dates from current ages
3. Consider allowing users to update their exact birth date

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Sample data seeding with various birth dates
- Age computation verification
- Search filtering by age ranges
- Profile retrieval with computed ages

All tests pass successfully, confirming:
- ✓ Date of birth is properly stored
- ✓ Age is correctly computed on retrieval
- ✓ Age-based filtering works in searches
- ✓ All existing functionality remains intact
